The error handling for database and notification channels is also commendable. However, there are a few minor improvements that could enhance the code further:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Add Type Hints:**\n",
      "   Consider adding type hints to the function and method parameters and return values. Type hints can help improve code readability and maintainability.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Move Sensitive Data to Environment Variables:**\n",
      "   Avoid hardcoding sensitive information like API keys and passwords in the code. Instead, store them securely as environment variables and access them at runtime. This improves security and makes it easier to manage credentials.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Utilize Logging:**\n",
      "   Incorporate logging to capture and record important events and errors during the execution of the program. Logging helps with debugging and troubleshooting issues.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Consider Unit Testing:**\n",
      "   Implementing unit tests for the individual components of the program can help catch errors early and ensure the correctness of the code.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Handle Database Errors Gracefully:**\n",
      "   In the `load_data_from_sql_database` method, if there is an exception while fetching data from the database, it's good practice to handle it gracefully and provide a meaningful error message instead of printing the exception.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Handle Failed Notifications:**\n",
      "   In the `main.py` file, if the email notification fails (i.e., `email_status_code` is not 202) or the SMS notification fails (i.e., `sms_sid` is `None`), it's important to handle these failures gracefully and take appropriate actions, such as retrying or escalating the issue.\n",

The error handling for database and notification channels is also commendable. However, there are a few minor improvements that could enhance the code further:\\n\\n1. **Add Type Hints:**\\n   Consider adding type hints to the function and method parameters and return values. Type hints can help improve code readability and maintainability.\\n\\n\\n2. **Move Sensitive Data to Environment Variables:**\\n   Avoid hardcoding sensitive information like API keys and passwords in the code. Instead, store them securely as environment variables and access them at runtime. This improves security and makes it easier to manage credentials.\\n\\n\\n3. **Utilize Logging:**\\n   Incorporate logging to capture and record important events and errors during the execution of the program. Logging helps with debugging and troubleshooting issues.\\n\\n\\n4. **Consider Unit Testing:**\\n   Implementing unit tests for the individual components of the program can help catch errors early and ensure the correctness of the code.\\n\\n\\n5. **Handle Database Errors Gracefully:**\\n   In the `load_data_from_sql_database` method, if there is an exception while fetching data from the database, it\\'s good practice to handle it gracefully and provide a meaningful error message instead of printing the exception.\\n\\n\\n6. **Handle Failed Notifications:**\\n   In the `main.py` file, if the email notification fails (i.e., `email_status_code` is not 202) or the SMS notification fails (i.e., `sms_sid` is `None`), it\\'s important to handle these failures gracefully and take appropriate actions, such as retrying or escalating the issue.\\n\\nRemember, these suggestions aim to enhance the code\\'s robustness, maintainability, and overall quality.

The error handling for database and notification channels is also commendable. However, there are a few minor improvements that could enhance the code further:\\n\\n1. **Add Type Hints:**\\n   Consider adding type hints to the function and method parameters and return values. Type hints can help improve code readability and maintainability.\\n\\n\\n2. **Move Sensitive Data to Environment Variables:**\\n   Avoid hardcoding sensitive information like API keys and passwords in the code. Instead, store them securely as environment variables and access them at runtime. This improves security and makes it easier to manage credentials.\\n\\n\\n3. **Utilize Logging:**\\n   Incorporate logging to capture and record important events and errors during the execution of the program. Logging helps with debugging and troubleshooting issues.\\n\\n\\n4. **Consider Unit Testing:**\\n   Implementing unit tests for the individual components of the program can help catch errors early and ensure the correctness of the code.\\n\\n\\n5. **Handle Database Errors Gracefully:**\\n   In the `load_data_from_sql_database` method, if there is an exception while fetching data from the database, it\\'s good practice to handle it gracefully and provide a meaningful error message instead of printing the exception.\\n\\n\\n6. **Handle Failed Notifications:**\\n   In the `main.py` file, if the email notification fails (i.e., `email_status_code` is not 202) or the SMS notification fails (i.e., `sms_sid` is `None`), it\\'s important to handle these failures gracefully and take appropriate actions, such as retrying or escalating the issue.\\n\\nRemember, these suggestions aim to enhance the code\\'s robustness, maintainability, and overall quality.

The error handling for database and notification channels is also commendable. However, there are a few minor improvements that could enhance the code further:\\\\n\\\\n1. **Add Type Hints:**\\\\n   Consider adding type hints to the function and method parameters and return values. Type hints can help improve code readability and maintainability.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n2. **Move Sensitive Data to Environment Variables:**\\\\n   Avoid hardcoding sensitive information like API keys and passwords in the code. Instead, store them securely as environment variables and access them at runtime. This improves security and makes it easier to manage credentials.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n3. **Utilize Logging:**\\\\n   Incorporate logging to capture and record important events and errors during the execution of the program. Logging helps with debugging and troubleshooting issues.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n4. **Consider Unit Testing:**\\\\n   Implementing unit tests for the individual components of the program can help catch errors early and ensure the correctness of the code.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n5. **Handle Database Errors Gracefully:**\\\\n   In the `load_data_from_sql_database` method, if there is an exception while fetching data from the database, it\\\\\\'s good practice to handle it gracefully and provide a meaningful error message instead of printing the exception.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n6. **Handle Failed Notifications:**\\\\n   In the `main.py` file, if the email notification fails (i.e., `email_status_code` is not 202) or the SMS notification fails (i.e., `sms_sid` is `None`), it\\\\\\'s important to handle these failures gracefully and take appropriate actions, such as retrying or escalating the issue.\\\\n\\\\nRemember, these suggestions aim to enhance the code\\\\\\'s robustness, maintainability, and overall quality.

Type hints can help improve code readability and maintainability.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n2. **Move Sensitive Data to Environment Variables:**\\\\n   Avoid hardcoding sensitive information like API keys and passwords in the code. Instead, store them securely as environment variables and access them at runtime. This improves security and makes it easier to manage credentials.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n3. **Utilize Logging:**\\\\n   Incorporate logging to capture and record important events and errors during the execution of the program. Logging helps with debugging and troubleshooting issues.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n4. **Consider Unit Testing:**\\\\n   Implementing unit tests for the individual components of the program can help catch errors early and ensure the correctness of the code.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n5. **Handle Database Errors Gracefully:**\\\\n   In the `load_data_from_sql_database` method, if there is an exception while fetching data from the database, it\\\\\\'s good practice to handle it gracefully and provide a meaningful error message instead of printing the exception.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n6. **Handle Failed Notifications:**\\\\n   In the `main.py` file, if the email notification fails (i.e., `email_status_code` is not 202) or the SMS notification fails (i.e., `sms_sid` is `None`), it\\\\\\'s important to handle these failures gracefully and take appropriate actions, such as retrying or escalating the issue.\\\\n\\\\nRemember, these suggestions aim to enhance the code\\\\\\'s robustness, maintainability, and overall quality.
